# DREAMIN'SG Integrated Power-Water-Transportation Simulation Platform

This document outlines the integrated simulation platform, including its model structure, capabilities, and limitations.

## 1. Project Summary

Climate change has caused an increase in the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events, with severe consequences on the urban infrastructure. The lack of standard methods and clear guidelines for dealing with these events aggravates the problem. In this context, this project aims to build a methodology to assess and predict the resilience of urban infrastructure systems and propose new pathways to develop innovative technologies and services for its improvement. We consider the urban infrastructure system which consists of the interdependent power, water, and transport systems, and develop an integrated simulation model to study its performance under various disruption and recovery scenarios. Based on the simulationgenerated datasets, interpretable machine learning algorithms are implemented to not only identify the correlation between different system features and the resilience output, but also their causal relationships. Building on the understanding of success features that make an urban system resilient, Design Science approaches are used to develop new solutions that mitigate the consequences of disruptions and accommodate constraints in the analyzed case studies. The results of the research will support local governments and system managers to improve infrastructure resilience against weather-related disruptions.
