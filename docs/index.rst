Welcome to InfraRisk Simulation Platform's documentation!
=========================================================

InfraRisk is an experimental Python-based integrated power-, water-, transport network simulation tool. This documentation provides guidelines to 
install, setup and use the tool for simulation and analysis of infrastructure networks.

We are continuously working to add new features and improve the tool. If you have any questions or suggestions, or would like to collaborate with us, please write to us
at `srijith.balakrishnan[at]sec.ethz.ch <mailto:srijith.balakrishnan@sec.ethz.ch>`_.
