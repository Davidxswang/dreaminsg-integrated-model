DREAMIN'SG Project
==================

This package is developed as part of the Disaster REsilience Assessment, Modelling, 
and INnovation Singapore (DREAMIN'SG) project at the Future Resilient Systems of the Singapore ETH Centre funded by the National
Research Foundation, Singapore. This project aims at studying the effects of policy interventions and network topological changes
on the resilience of interdependent water-power-transportation networks. Given the critical nature of 
the above infrastructure systems, their interdependencies need to be considered in pre- and post-disaster
resilience actions. The methodology adopted in the study is presented in Figure 1.
