# InfraSim: A simulation tool for analyzing interdependent infrastructure networks

A Python -based model to simulate the cascading failures in interdependent urban water-power-transportation networks.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 - Operating System: Windows 10
 - Python 3.7+
 - Anaconda

### Installation
Please follow the steps below to setup the DREAMIN'SG Integrated Simulation Platform.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/srijithbalakrishnan/dreaminsg-integrated-model.git folder-name
```
 2. Create a new python virtual environment with all required packages needed to run the simulation platform
 ```
 conda env create -f environment.yml
 ``` 

## Help
