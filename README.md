# InfraRisk: A simulation tool for interdependent infrastructure simulation

A Python -based model to simulate the interdependent failures in interdependent water-power-transport networks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Operating System: Windows 10
- Python 3.7+
- Anaconda

### Installation

Please follow the steps below to setup the InfraRisk Integrated Simulation Platform.

 1. Clone the InfraRisk integrated simulation platfom repository from [Github](https://github.com/srijithbalakrishnan/dreaminsg-integrated-model.git).

```
git clone https://github.com/srijithbalakrishnan/dreaminsg-integrated-model.git folder-name
```

 2. Create a new python virtual environment with all required packages needed to run the simulation platform

 ```
 conda env create --name ENV_NAME --file=environment.ym
 ```

 3. Install the InfraRisk package in the created environment. Go to the project folder and run the following command:

 ```
 conda activate redcar
 pip install â€“-editable .
 ```

## Help

For instructions to run sample simulation on the simple network testbed, please refer to ```notebooks/event_based_simulations/simple_network.ipynb``` (faster).

For instructions to run sample simulation on the Micropolis testbed, please refer to ```notebooks/event_based_simulations/micropolis_network.ipynb``` (slower).

For instructions to run sample simulation on the Shelby County testbed, please refer to ```notebooks/event_based_simulations/shelby_county.ipynb``` (slower).

For instructions to run MPC optimization on the simple network testbed, please refer to ```notebooks/recovery_optimization/demo_optimization_incomplete.ipynb``` (faster). The notebook works for the current disruptive event (``test1``). However, please note that there could be an issue of infinite loops when performing MPC optimization of repair sequence for disruptions involving inaccessible components. The bug will be rectified soon.

For generating various hazards, see tutorials in ```notebooks/hazard_generation/```

Full documentation is available at ```dreaminsg_documentation.pdf``` or HTML version is available in [Read the Docs website](https://dreaminsg-integrated-model.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Please do note some sections need to be updated and the process is going on.
